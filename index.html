<h1>Presidential Election:</h1>
<div><h2>Hillary Clinton</h2>
<p>Hillary is a <b>woman</b> who wants to be the first president of US. However, that doesn’t <i>qualify</i> her to be president.</p>

<div>
<h2>Trump</h2>
<p>Donald Trump is a <b>business man </b>and wanted to be the president as well,
  however he is very <i>biased</i> towards religion and ethnicity.
  He may not be chosen that’s what I feel.
</p>
He once said, <blockquote>"all muslims are terrorist"</blockquote>
